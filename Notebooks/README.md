# Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used in the WCE-Bleed-Gen project.

Each notebook follows a structured workflow:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Dataset splitting and augmentation
- Model definition (classification + segmentation)
- Training and validation loops
- Evaluation metrics and visualizations

The notebooks are intended for experimentation, training, and result analysis.
Reusable components may later be refactored into standalone Python modules.
